                <h4>10. Additional Company Rights</h4>
                <p>
                    The Company reserves the following rights:
                <ul><li>to release current or past Registration Data (as defined below), Post Data, or other information pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and/or the Privacy Policy in the event the Company believes that the User is in violation of this Agreement, the Site is used to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, and/or if the Company deems it necessary and/or appropriate.
                    </li><li>	to remove Post Data from the Site.
                    </li><li>to deny Service to offenders of this Agreement.
                    </li><li>to deny access to the Site or terminate or cancel User's accounts for anyone or any User for any reason or no reason
                    </li></ul>
                <p class="pt-20"></p>The Company reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site with or without notice to the User. The User agrees that Site shall not be liable to the User or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of the Site. The User acknowledges and agrees that any termination of the Site under any provision of this Agreement may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledges and agrees that the Company may immediately delete data and files in the User's account and bar any further access to such files or the Site.
                <p class="pt-20"></p>The Company owns certain things on this system, including the 'look and feel' of the system, the name of the system, the collective work copyright in sequences of public messages on the system, and the business method. The User cannot reproduce any message thread from the system, either electronically or in print, without the Company's permission and the permission of all participants in the thread. This is not a complete list - other things on the system are also the Company's property. Contact the Company before copying anything from the system with plans of reproducing it or distributing it.
                <p class="pt-20"></p>The User acknowledges and agrees that content, including but not limited to text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, page layout and design, or other material contained in the Site or information presented through the Site is protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, or other proprietary rights and laws.

                <p class="pt-40"></p>
                <h4>11. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h4>
                <p>A great danger for the Company, and for all operators of online networks, is that we might be held accountable for the wrongful actions of our users. If one user libels another user, the injured user might blame us, even though the first user was really at fault. If a user uploads a program with a computer virus, and the other users' computers are damaged, we might be blamed even though a user left the virus on our Site. If a user transmits illegal or improper information to another user, we might be blamed even though we did nothing more than unknowingly carry the message from one user to another. Accordingly, we need all users to accept responsibility for their own acts, and to accept that an act by another user that damages them must not be blamed on us, but only on the other user.
                    <p class="pt-20"></p>Although it is the Company's goal to provide users with a reliable, quality system, we may make mistakes or experience system failure from time to time. Such problems are inevitable in operating any computer based website. We would not be able to make this network available to users if we had to accept blame or financial liability for any usability problems, system failures or errors, or mistakes or damages of any kind. In order to continue offering and improving our service, the Company must deny any warranties on this service and insure that our liability for any problems connected with the use of our system is strictly limited.
                    <p class="pt-20"></p>These needs are accomplished by the following disclaimers:
                </p>

                <p><strong>THE USER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT THE USER'S SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.

THE USER FURTHER AGREES THAT THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, WHETHER SUCH INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION WAS JUSTIFIED OR NOT, NEGLIGENT OR INTENTIONAL, INADVERTENT OR ADVERTENT.</strong>

The arbitrator shall also have jurisdiction to decide claims for interim or preliminary relief pursuant to the Association's Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection. Pre-hearing exchange of information shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Colorado law. The arbitrator will render a written award and opinion that reveals the essential findings and conclusions upon which the award is based.</strong></p>
                <p class="pt-40"></p>

                <h4>13. Registration Data; Account Security</h4>
                </p>In consideration of the User's use of the Site, the User agrees to provide accurate, current and complete information about the User as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Site ("Registration Data"); maintain the security of the User's password and identification; maintain and promptly update the User's Registration Data, and any other information the User provides to the Company, to keep it accurate, current and complete; and (d) accept all risks of unauthorized access to the Registration Data and any other information the User provides to Company.

                </p>
                <p class="pt-40"></p>

                <h4>14. Miscellaneous Terms</h4>
                The User can reach or access the Site from all fifty states, U.S. territories and possessions, and around the world. Each of these places has a different set of laws. Since the Company cannot keep track of all these laws and their requirements, the Agreement and the relationship between the User and the Company shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
                <p class="pt-20"></p>If the Company fails to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement or other incorporated agreements, that failure shall not be used to prove or be construed that the Company has waived the right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement or other incorporated agreements is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the User nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. The User agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or Services or the Agreement or incorporated agreements must be filed by the User or third party within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
