A good article here can gain social takeoff on other social networks  as well.  The Share Function provides equal prominence to the big three – LinkedIn, Facebook & Twitter.

       <h3> LinkedIn has PULSE;<br/>

AeroNet has SKYWRITER.  </h3>
                  <p>Both are platforms for bloggers and "Thought Leaders" to get their articles in front of the masses, brand them-selfs and/or their business, while creating an opportunity to extend their network and reach.  However, AeroNet's Skywriter has 2 major advantages over Linkedin's Pulse:  </p>
                   
                    <p class="pt-20"></p>
                                 <ul><ol><p>
                       1 -  On the front-end, the shear size of LinkedIn's network hinders ones ability to get an aviation specific article beyond ones network and into Pulses' News Feed. 
                             </p>
                         
                                     
                         </ol></ul>
                     
                     <h6> As Jeff Hayden of Inc. Magazine puts it "If even a fraction of LinkedIn's '467' million-plus users publish articles, that will result in a lot of content fighting for attention."</h6>                 
                     
                     <ul><ol>
                             
                             <p class="pt-40"></p>
                      2 -    On the back-end we use the line of code "rel=canonical".  By using this code, AeroNet is telling Google to give all credit for that page to the writer and not to index the AeroNet page within Google’s search results if a duplicate article was also published by the writer elsewhere.  This control of content is something LinkedIn has yet to show any signs of relinquishing.     </p>
                         
                                     
                         </ol></ul>
                     
                     <h6>As Neil Patel, SEO specialist at KISSmetrics explains; "reposting your content on sites more authoritative than yours, even if you publish it first on your blog and have them link back, can cause a duplicate content penalty."  Drastically lowering your Google page rank.</h6>
                     <p class="pt-40"></p>
                     <h3>FEATURED ARTICLES</h3>

The more an article is viewed, liked, shared and positively commented on, the higher it is placed up the Trending News feed.  Continually positioning it in front of  the AeroNet community, with the ultimate goal of going "viral"
