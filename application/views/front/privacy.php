                <h3>SITE SECURITY</h3>
                <p class="pt-20"></p>
                <h4>END-TO-END HTTPS</h4>
                <p>AeroNet.io is a secure site, employing HTTPS encryption protocols end-to-end. Every page of AeroNet.io is pulled from secure severs, not just login.  It 's the same security banks use.</p>
                <!--<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="<?php echo RIZ_ASSETS; ?>images/slider/security.JPG" class="img-responsive"></div>
                -->

                
                <p>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure – it adds the security properties of the Secure Socket Layer(SSL) cryptographic protocols to provide secure communication over the internet.  

</p>
<p>Sometimes on unsecured sites, data is stolen not from a database but pulled directly from the stream of information flowing to and from your computer or phone.  AeroNet.io also employs end-to-end HTTPS traffic encryption to protect this streaming information.</p>

                <h3>SITE SECURITY AND SOCIAL NETWORKING</h3>
                <p>AeroNet.io also goes a step further than most public social networking platforms. Social sites like Twitter and Facebook have Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs give anyone with web development skills the ability to push and pull data from one site for use on other websites, within mobile apps, and elsewhere. AeroNet.io has aligned our security in similar fashion to LinkedIn; there are no APIs, which means your resume information can’t be shared, and can’t be found on other sites or search engines. </p>
                <p>Additionally, we will Never ask for, nor is there a place to input your Date of Birth or Social Security Number on your public profile.</p>

               <p>Here at AeroNet.io, security is of utmost priority:  We continually work with an  industry leading cyber security company (DiTi) to ensure we are employing the latest encryption technology. </p>
